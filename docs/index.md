    - **Do you want to gain effectiveness in explaining your science to a general audience?**
    - **Do you want to confront your anxiety around public speaking?**
    - **Do you want to become more fluid at faciliating or participating in Zoom meetings?**

The University of Arizona Biosciences Toastmasters Club provides a comfortable environment for students, scientists, and professionals to practice speaking and leadership skills, an area of development often overlooked in specialized higher education.

Our members -- faculty, appointed professionals and staff, graduate and undergraduate students -- support each other as we become the speakers and leaders we want to be.

The club is open to all University of Arizona and non-UArizona associated personnel, especially scientists and science-lovers. Interested guests are welcome to drop by!

**Biosciences Toastmasters currently holds hybrid meetings (in person and on Zoom.) Meeting location is Arizona Health Sciences Library room 2141. Guests may request the Zoom link by clicking the “Contact Us” link on the top of this page.**

Check the [Meeting Info/Directions](info.md) above for a map and info on parking areas.

    **Biosciences Toastmasters Diversity Statement**
    </p>
    Biosciences Toastmasters strives to nurture a culture of inclusivity and diversity. While we cater to scientists and science lovers, we take pride in our club’s diverse membership across lines of race, ethnicity, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, political affiliation, religious views, and any other differences. To maintain an atmosphere in which members can gain the confidence to be vulnerable and expand their boundaries, Biosciences Toastmasters expects members and guests to be mindful of this diversity, using good judgment and sensitivity when selecting speech topics, content, and language.

    The [policy of Toastmasters International](https://www.toastmasters.org/leadership-central/governing-documents) is not to discriminate, in the conduct of its programs and activities, against any persons on the basis of age (except those persons under 18 years of age), race, color, creed, gender, national or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, or physical or mental disability, so long as the individuals, through their own effort, are able to participate in the program or activity.

    Further, the club may be experienced as an extension of the classroom or workplace, where members have rights to an atmosphere free of discriminatory comments. As a club on the University of Arizona campus, we are required to follow the [university’s policy on nondiscrimination and harassment](https://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy), which prohibits discrimination, including harassment and retaliation, based on a protected classification, including race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or genetic information. Any guest or member who creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for academic pursuits, employment, or participation in university-sponsored activities may be asked to leave.

    We understand that inclusion is active and not passive, and are committed to maintaining the culture our club has developed over its history.
