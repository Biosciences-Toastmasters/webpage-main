!!! Abstract "## 2023, May 19th"

    Last week, we practiced our extemporaneous speaking skills with two cycles of "Round Robin" Table Topics.
    
    We learned about **Sarah**'s childhood in a small village in upstate New York, where she had numerous childhood adventures (and injuries). She recounted the many times she's broken a bone, including falling off a motorcycle while looking for her dog, falling off a beach ball while watching cartoons, and riding a skateboard behind a bus.
    
    **Susan** also talked about growing up in a small town in upstate New York (nowhere near Sarah's hometown, though). While she still does go back to visit family, she wouldn't want to live in a small town again because there's not enough to do other than gossip about everyone else's business.
    
    **Anna** talked about a vegetarian "BLT salad" she recently made, which didn't have any meatless analogue for the "B" so she put in fake bacon anyway. Later, she reflected on the Eleanor Roosevelt quote "Do what you feel in your heart to be right, for you'll be criticized anyway. You'll be damned if you do, and damned if you don't."
    
    **Jim** remembered teaching both of his daughters to drive stick shift, and said that while there may be some danger involved during the learning phase, once you learn, it's "like riding a bicycle." He also thought of an Eleanor Roosevelt quote he likes: "No one can make you feel inferior without your consent."
    
    Last but not least, Jenn remembered a vacation to Turkey that overlapped with Ataturk Day, one of the country's most important holidays, and wondered what's going on there now that its current dictator is consolidating power. When asked about her favorite article of clothing, she said that she tends not to wear her favorite things out of fear of wearing them out faster. Perhaps, she said, this is a logical fallacy and she should instead wear her favorite things while she can, since styles and bodies and life circumstances change.
