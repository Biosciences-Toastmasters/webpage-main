Do you want to improve your public speaking skills? Join us on Wednesdays from noon-1 p.m. Do you want to gain effectiveness in explaining your science to a general audience? Do you want to confront your anxiety around public speaking? Do you want to become more fluid at faciliating or participating in Zoom meetings? The University of Arizona Biosciences Toastmasters Club provides a comfortable environment for students, scientists, and professionals to practice speaking and leadership skills, an area of development often overlooked in specialized higher education. Our members -- faculty, appointed professionals and staff, graduate and undergraduate students -- support each other as we become the speakers and leaders we want to be. The club is open to all University of Arizona and non-UArizona associated personnel, especially scientists and science-lovers. Interested guests are welcome to drop by! Biosciences Toastmasters currently holds hybrid meetings (in person and on Zoom.) Meeting location is Arizona Health Sciences Library room 2141. Guests may request the Zoom link by clicking the \u201cContact Us\u201d link on the top of this page. Check the Meeting Info/Directions above for a map and info on parking areas. The spring 2023 members. Biosciences Toastmasters Diversity Statement Biosciences Toastmasters strives to nurture a culture of inclusivity and diversity. While we cater to scientists and science lovers, we take pride in our club\u2019s diverse membership across lines of race, ethnicity, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, political affiliation, religious views, and any other differences. To maintain an atmosphere in which members can gain the confidence to be vulnerable and expand their boundaries, Biosciences Toastmasters expects members and guests to be mindful of this diversity, using good judgment and sensitivity when selecting speech topics, content, and language. The policy of Toastmasters International is not to discriminate, in the conduct of its programs and activities, against any persons on the basis of age (except those persons under 18 years of age), race, color, creed, gender, national or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, or physical or mental disability, so long as the individuals, through their own effort, are able to participate in the program or activity. Further, the club may be experienced as an extension of the classroom or workplace, where members have rights to an atmosphere free of discriminatory comments. As a club on the University of Arizona campus, we are required to follow the university\u2019s policy on nondiscrimination and harassment , which prohibits discrimination, including harassment and retaliation, based on a protected classification, including race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or genetic information. Any guest or member who creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for academic pursuits, employment, or participation in university-sponsored activities may be asked to leave. We understand that inclusion is active and not passive, and are committed to maintaining the culture our club has developed over its history.","title":"Home"},{"location":"info/","text":"Meeting Informations / Directions \u00b6 Biosciences Toastmasters currently holds hybrid meetings in person and on Zoom.

He did a great job speaking frankly and humorously, and incorporated some fantastic vocabulary and colorful turns of phrase. We got to know him a little better and learned from his experiences with this pathway. Table Topics was fun, led by Susan who curated some Chat Pack questions on the fly for some especially nice prompts. We learned that Anna might choose to inhabit a chocolate factory all by herself, if only to cure her chocolate habit by overindulging, and that Michele 's morning radio show would feature 30 minutes of rambling with no music, and the entire world would listen without judgment. Sarah shared that, if she were given the chance to travel 50 years into the future, she'd be curious to see how we're doing in terms of food, energy, and all the other things present-day humans are resistant to reform. Jim reported that the best $100 he ever spent might have been on a stereo, and he remembered how scarce money was as he was growing up, raised by a single mom who had been widowed young. Jenn was asked what \"one fact\" she'd like to know about everyone she meets, and she replied that she was touched to learn about Jim's childhood struggles and thought that knowing about everyone's early-life adversities would help us understand each other better. 2023, June 19 th \u00b6 Last week, we practiced our extemporaneous speaking skills with two cycles of \"Round Robin\" Table Topics. We learned about Sarah 's childhood in a small village in upstate New York, where she had numerous childhood adventures (and injuries). She recounted the many times she's broken a bone, including falling off a motorcycle while looking for her dog, falling off a beach ball while watching cartoons, and riding a skateboard behind a bus. Susan also talked about growing up in a small town in upstate New York (nowhere near Sarah's hometown, though). While she still does go back to visit family, she wouldn't want to live in a small town again because there's not enough to do other than gossip about everyone else's business. Anna talked about a vegetarian \"BLT salad\" she recently made, which didn't have any meatless analogue for the \"B\" so she put in fake bacon anyway. Later, she reflected on the Eleanor Roosevelt quote \"Do what you feel in your heart to be right, for you'll be criticized anyway. You'll be damned if you do, and damned if you don't.\" Jim remembered teaching both of his daughters to drive stick shift, and said that while there may be some danger involved during the learning phase, once you learn, it's \"like riding a bicycle.\" He also thought of an Eleanor Roosevelt quote he likes: \"No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.\" Last but not least, Jenn remembered a vacation to Turkey that overlapped with Ataturk Day, one of the country's most important holidays, and wondered what's going on there now that its current dictator is consolidating power. When asked about her favorite article of clothing, she said that she tends not to wear her favorite things out of fear of wearing them out faster. Perhaps, she said, this is a logical fallacy and she should instead wear her favorite things while she can, since styles and bodies and life circumstances change. 2023, June 12 th \u00b6 Last week, Jenn practiced a Grand Rounds presentation that she (successfully!) gave the following day, providing us with an overview of the intersection of mental health and chronic pain. As always, her speech was well-composed with excellent data visualization. We learned how the perception of pain can be amplified in people with mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and trauma, and how they can all enter into a feedback loop to exacerbate each problem. We learned more about Jenn's research goals and how she hopes her discoveries will be used to improve the lives of people living with depression, anxiety, and chronic pain.","title":"Newsletters"},{"location":"newsletter/#in-case-you-missed-it-the-newsletters-blog","text":"","title":"In Case You Missed It: the Newsletters Blog"},{"location":"newsletter/#2023-june-27th","text":"Last week, Jim gave a speech to cap off his experience with the Presentation Mastery pathway.
